#odin-landing-page

This repository was created for the Flexbox Activity of The Odin's Project Foundations Course.

In this project, we are asked to create an entire web page based on a design given (please see 'given-design' folder for reference). 

For this specific task, our learnings - not only from the Flexible Box Model Layout and its properties; but also from the best practices from the beginning of the Foundations Curriculum was applied, which include:
- setting up git repository, and cloning it into local machine;
- often git commit to establish atomic commit;
- recalling learned git commands from previous exercises;
- using proper html elements;
- applying css properties/tricks learned from the previous exercises;
- utilizing the ANALYTICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING SKILLS for web developing;
- HAVING FUN WHILE CODING, OFCOURSE! <3
